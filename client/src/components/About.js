            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this version of checkers amused you— there are a lot of checkers apps out there, and I wanted to put my own spin on the ruleset. When I was a kid, I was told that you didn’t have to jump a piece if you didn’t want to, but if you did a single-jump, you were obligated to double (or triple) jump if it was possible. Sure, it <strong>might</strong> have been a forgiving way to play, but it also allows an opponent to set up traps where a king has to double jump and be subsequently taken. Happy playing!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This checkers app was created as a solo project by me, Matthew Dwinell. It was built in react using functional components, browser router, and a good chunk of spare time. For more information about projects I’ve worked on, feel free to check out my <a href='https://mattdwinell.github.io' rel='noreferrer' target='_blank'>web portfolio</a>.</p>
